To see how to embed swf and pass parameters to it look at index.html in bin

How to run example on your server:
Create database and table with database.sql
Extract files to flashphoto directory in root of apache server
Edit config.php and set your settings.
Example files must be in directory flashphoto in root of apache server(this can be changed if you edit SERVER_ROOT in config.php)
http://localhost:8080/flashphoto/bin/ to run or simular(change apache port if needed)
